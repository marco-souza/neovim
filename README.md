# Vim Setup

My personal vim config

It uses [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/) with the following plugins
- fuzzy finder
- git
- language support for Go, JS and Python

## Usage

For MacOS and Linux, just copy and paste the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-souza/vim-setup/main/setup.sh | bash
```
